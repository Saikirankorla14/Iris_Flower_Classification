# Iris_Flower_Classification

Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using supervised machine learning techniques. The classification is based on the measurement of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers.
Dataset
The dataset used is the UCI Iris Dataset, which contains 150 records of iris flowers with four features each, along with the corresponding species label. It is a widely used dataset for testing classification algorithms.
Methodology
- Data Visualization: Explored feature distributions using Seaborn pair plots and box plots.
- Data Preprocessing: Checked for missing values and normalized data if necessary.
- Model Training:
   • Decision Tree Classifier.
   • Support Vector Machine (SVM) for comparison.
- Evaluation: Model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Pandas and NumPy
- Matplotlib
How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip.
3. Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets or from a CSV file.
4. Train the classification model using Decision Tree or SVM.
5. Evaluate and visualize the results.
Results
The models achieved high classification accuracy (typically above 95%) on the Iris dataset. Visualization of decision boundaries and confusion matrices confirmed the effectiveness of the classifiers.
